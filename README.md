## Overview
I used just HTML, CSS and JS without frameworks to complete this task;

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- RWD

### What I learned

I've learned great deal about working with REST Api, local storage - finally I could apply my trainings in an environment different than codewars.

### Continued development

I would love to get better at dark theme optimization. Also once I learn React, would be great to return with a new solution.
